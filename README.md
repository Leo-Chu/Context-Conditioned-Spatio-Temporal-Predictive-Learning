# Context-Conditioned-Spatio-Temporal-Predictive-Learning


I uploaded the network module of the proposed method. It can be easily integrated into the well-known predictive tasks in the literature, such as predrnn, convlstm. For example, use the module in the well-known PredRNNN (https://github.com/thuml/predrnn-pytorch)
